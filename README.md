# Brain Tumor Detection
> Creation Date: December, 2021
## Description
The computer-aided tumor detection systems and convolutional neural networks provided
success stories and have made important strides in the field of machine learning. The deep
convolutional layers extract important and robust features automatically from the input space
as compared to traditional predecessor neural network layers. Hence, we will firstly build a
custom model through CNN and then we will build a pretrained model on the same dataset to
also provide a comparison between models.
