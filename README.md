# Brain Tumor Detection
> Creation Date: December, 2021
## Description
Convolutional neural networks and computer-aided tumour detection systems have made significant advancements in machine learning and offered success stories. When compared to conventional previous neural network layers, the deep convolutional layers automatically extract significant and reliable information from the input space. As a result, we first utilised CNN to create a unique model, and then we used a pretrained model on the same dataset and lastly we contrasted the outcomes of both models.
